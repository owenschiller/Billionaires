I am doing research on the CORGIS data set Billionaires. Since I have already made most of my website, my plan is just of
the graph of data that I am going to show. For my X coordinate (the bottom), I am going to do the how old they are, and for the Y coordinate (the side), I am going to do their worth in billions. I will be using a box plot to 
display my data.
